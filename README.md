## Connected Drink Dispenser Workshop

Code and walk-through to assemble, program and build a multi-user Amazon FreeRTOS and AWS IoT enabled drink dispenser.

This is the base repository that when cloned, will walk you through the steps to build, deploy, and run in your own AWS account.

### Getting Started Quickly

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/connected-drink-dispenser-workshop.git
```
Next, navigate to the `connected-drink-dispenser-workshop/hugo/public` directory and double-click `index.hmtl`. This will bring up a local version of the documentation.

From the main *Welcome to the Connected Drink Dispenser Workshop!* page, click on the *Setting Up the Workshop* link in the left navigation column. From there you can navigate through the steps to complete prerequisites, deploy the stack, and then to deploy the documentation for participants to use.
