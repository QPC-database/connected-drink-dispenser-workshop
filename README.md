# Connected Drink Dispenser Workshop

<img align="left" height="400" src="docs/hugo/static/images/model-trans-bg.png">
<p>Code and walk-through to assemble, program and build your very own multi-user Amazon FreeRTOS and AWS IoT enabled drink dispenser.</p>

<p>This is the base repository that when cloned, will walk you through the steps to build, deploy, and run in your own AWS account.</p>
<p>The workshop participants will work with hardware and micro controllers, and then interact with their, and others, drink dispensers through a software-a-a-service (SaaS) set of Cloud components.</p>
