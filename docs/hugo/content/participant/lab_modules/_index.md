## Individual Module Overview

There are various modules to complete in this workshop. Each module has a specific set of objectives to complete, with the overall goal of the workshop being for you to build, program, and be able to dispense a drink. Each module is laid out in a similar manner:

* **Objective**<br/>A short explanation of *what* you will be accomplishing, and *why*.
* **Steps**<br/>Both high-level steps to complete the module, and a twirl-down with specific step-by-step instructions
* **Checkpoint**<br/>A completed list of what comes from the objectives that needs to be validated before moving on to the next steps.
* **Outcomes** (optional)<br/>Depending upon the module, this section describes how the steps taken above help for the workshop or general AWS IoT development patterns.
