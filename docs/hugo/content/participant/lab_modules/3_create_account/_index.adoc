## Objectives


This lab module will walk though creation of user and account resources, and accessing your unique resources. By the end of the module you will have:

* Created and verify a user account.
* Understand what takes places during account creation.
* Know where to navigate in order to download and access your specific resources such as certificate and private key, and access other user details.
* Been introduced to UML https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_diagram[sequence diagrams] used to illustrate operations.

## Resource Creation Process

When you first go through the user creation process, there are no resources created in advance. Once you log in for the first time, the API call that returns your resources will notice there are none and will go about creating them. At a high level, the process looks like this:

. User John Doe registers and verifies new account `jdoe`.
. User created in Cognito User Pool and valid JSON web token returned.
. As this is the first login, a call to the `/getResources` method is called and invokes a Lambda function.
. The function creates all of the unique resources for John on a per-service basis.
. The following resources are created and the results return to the Lambda function:
.. An AWS IoT thing (dispenser) and certificate are created, and associated
.. An IAM user account is created with generated password
.. A Cloud9 development environment is create
. All of the created resources are stored in a DynamoDB table that can only be accessed by the Lambda function.

Finally, the `/getResources` returns John's specific details to be used or displayed in the webapp. This same sequence of events can also be presented using a sequence diagram. Each actor or participant is a column, and from top to bottom are the activities. See if you can associate the diagram above from this sequence diagram figure:

Sequence diagrams a consistent way to depict the flow of steps, especially for complex or multi-step operations. Depending upon what is being described, either of these may be used in the lab modules. Now that you have an understanding of what is taking place behind the scenes, it's time to create your account!

## Steps to Complete

Follow each step in order and use the _Open for detailed step-by-step instructions_ if required to create your account and access the resources.

### 1. Register for an Account

Open URL provided in the presentation, and click on the [underline blue]#create a new account# link, or from the SIGN IN link, click on the [blue underline]#Sign up# link at the bottom of the Sign in page. For your account, enter a _Username_, _Password_, and _Phone number_ for your mobile phone to receive a validation code. Once you receive the verification code, enter it to complete the account sign up process. 

{{% notice info %}}
The phone number must be in the "+county code" format. For instance, a US number would be "+18005551212" and for the UK "+447624...", etc. If you have questions about the format, or are unable to receive an SMS message, please let one of the lab helpers know and they can complete the process for you.

. Navigate to the URL provided during the workshop overview. `https://cdd.example.com` will be used in these instructions, replace with what was provided.
. From the _Welcome to the Connected Drink Dispenser Workshop!_ section, click on the [blue underline]#create a new account# link.

. Choose a _username_ (an e-mail address works and will not be used to send any emails), _password_, and enter your mobile number for SMS verification code.

. The page will refresh to the _Confirm sign up_ page to enter the _Confirmation code_. Check your phone for the 6-digit code, enter it, and click _CONFIRM_. If successful you will directed to the Sign in page.

### 2. Initial Log In

With the account created and on the _Sign in_ page, log in with your _username_/_password_. Initially you will see a _Loading Resource_ page, and during this first log in, it will pause while the resources are created in the background. This can take approximately 30 seconds or so to complete. Once complete, the dispenser details page will load. Click the _MY DETAILS_ button to open the resources section. Click on the _CERTIFICATE FILE_, _PRIVATE KEY FILE_, and _AMAZON ROOT CA1 FILE_ links and save the files to your `cdd` directory on your laptop. Click the _MY DETAILS_ button to toggle closed.

. From the _Sign in page_, enter your your _username_ and _password_ and click _LOG IN_.
. The _Loading Resource_ page will appear, followed after a few seconds a notice about resource creation. *Do not refresh or click other links at this point.* Resource creation can take approximately 30 seconds or so to complete.

. Once the resources have loaded, toggle the _MY DETAILS_ button to open the resources section. Click on the _CERTIFICATE FILE_, _PRIVATE KEY FILE_, and _AMAZON ROOT CA1 FILE_ links and save the files to your `cdd` directory on your laptop. Click the _MY DETAILS_ button to toggle closed.

. After downloading the files, note that your username appears in the upper right corner indicating you are logged in, and your unique dispenser number and credits are noted in the upper left.

## Checkpoints

Please ensure the following checkpoints are validated before moving on to the next module.

. You have successfully created a user account and saved the user username and password for future use.
. You have downloaded the certificate file (e.g., `34ea05fe7b-certificate.pem.crt`), private key (e.g., `34ea05fe7b-private.pem.key`) and root certificate CA (`AmazonRootCA1.pem`). This validates that all resources have been created in the cloud based on your username and assigned dispenser Id.

## Outcomes

We provided a detailed explanation of what happens during account and resource creation to show a process for just in time registration of resources. In our case, it was the creation of the user account and resources, but a similar pattern can also be used to generate AWS IoT things, certificates, and policies _just_ as a new device needs them, and not in advance.

If you are interested in how the resource creation process takes place, look at the code for the `ApiGetResourcesFunction` Lambda function when you are logged into the AWS Console.
