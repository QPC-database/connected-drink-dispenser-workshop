	<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_objectives">Objectives</h2><p>This lab module will walk through how the dispenser, dispenser app, and coupled services interact. It will go into level of detail specific for the workshop. If you would like to review more details, please reference the <a href="../../presenter.html">Setting Up the Workshop</a> documentation for deeper insights.</p>
<p>By then end of this module you will have:</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li>An understanding of the relationship between the dispenser (<em>Thing</em>), your Cognito user, and the DynamoDB database tables that track and log dispenser activity and state.</li><li>Seen how the dispenser <em>Thing</em> uses the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-device-shadows.html">Device Shadow Service for AWS IoT</a> to get notified of the requested state changes, and how it uses to acknowledge a dispense <em>request</em> with a <em>dispense</em> response.</li><li>Tested a <em>dispense</em> operation and monitored what takes place in different scenarios.</li><li>Reviewed dispenser activity both in the DynamoDB <em>EventsTable</em> and in the dispenser app logging.</li><li>An understanding of how the dispenser app along with the API Lambda functions control how to give credits to others dispensers, as well as ensuring that a dispense event can on;y be initiated when there sufficient credits.</li></ul></div></section>

<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_1_understand_the_aws_iot_thing_cognito_user_and_dynamodb_table_relationships">1. Understand the AWS IoT Thing, Cognito User, and DynamoDB Table Relationships</h3><p>As this solution is designed as a software-as-a-service (SaaS) environment, there needs to be a specific relationship between all of the resources to help enforce the security and operational controls of the actions. At a high level this is how the resources are associated with each other:</p>
<figure class="image-block"><img src="../../Relationship_services.svg" alt="Relationship services" width="806" height="646">
<figcaption>Figure 1. Relationship between services</figcaption></figure>
<p>Each thing has a unique X.509 client certificate for authentication allowing the dispenser to connect to AWS IoT and publish and subscribe to the MQTT topics specific for that dispenser. This authorization of MQTT topics comes from a common policy attached to the certificate that uses substitution variables that read the <em>Common Name</em> value from the X.509 certificate which contains the dispenser Id. This allows for an easier management of the authorization policies, as a single policy can be used for all dispensers. The relationship between the dispenser and the user is modeled into a Cognito User attribute, <code>custom:dispenserId</code>, that is read for every API call. Finally, your dispenser has an entry in the DynamoDB <em>DispenserTable</em> that tracks the credit balance and any in-flight or stale command operations.</p>
<p>Go to the AWS Console to review the relationships for your dispenser and your own user in the following AWS services:</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li><strong>AWS IoT Core</strong> - View your thing, the attached certificate details, and the policy associated with the certificate. Also, view the other security policy that is associated with your Cognito user (used to monitor update events).</li><li><strong>Amazon Cognito</strong> - From <em>Manage User Pools</em>, select the <em>workshop-users</em>, Users and Groups, then select your username. Note the <code>custom:group</code> and <code>custom:dispenserId</code> attribute values.</li><li><strong>Amazon DynamoDB</strong> - From the <em>DispenserTable</em> review the credits value for your dispenser via the <em>dispenserId</em> sort key. From the <em>DispenserEvents</em> table, query with the partition key equal to your dispenserId. As others start to create and operate their dispensers, filtering will limit to just your events.</li></ul></div>

Monitor Shadow Changes for a Simple Operation (toggle LED Ring status)</h3><p>The <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-device-shadows.html">Device Shadow Service for AWS IoT</a> is a service that can be used by things and applications to set and track the state of device. There are two main sections in the shadow document: the <em>desired</em> state and the <em>reported</em> state. In our solution the desired settings originate from the dispenser app. The dispenser acts upon them and set the correct reported state.</p>
<figure class="image-block"><img src="../../shadow%20state%20changes.svg" alt="shadow state changes" width="943" height="276">
<figcaption>Figure 2. Shadow state changes</figcaption></figure>
<p>To see this in action, from the AWS Console navigate to your Thing in IoT Core, then select <em>Shadow</em> which will show the current shadow document. Note the <code>led</code> attribute in the <em>desired</em> and <em>reported</em> sections, which should be the same. Also notice the value for <code>version</code> in the metadata. This increments each time the shadow is updated. To see how the shadow is working, use the dispenser app to change the state of the LED by either toggling or setting to the other state. You will see the value for <code>led</code> has changed in the shadow document, in both <em>desired</em> and <em>reported</em> sections, and <code>version</code> has incremented.</p>
<p>To see how the shadow works when the device is in a disconnected state, unplug the microcontroller from your laptop. Now, in the dispenser app change the state of the LED and notice that the <em>desired</em> change to show the new value but that the <em>reported</em> state is still what the dispenser was in before being disconnected. Notice also that a new <em>delta</em> section has appeared in the document, containing just this <code>led</code> field. This is automatically calculated by the Shadow service. Plug the microcontroller back into your laptop. Once it has booted and connected AWS IoT, the LED will change to the <em>desired</em> state value and the dispenser will update the <em>reported</em> state. Since <em>desired</em> and <em>reported</em> states are the same, the <em>delta</em> state for the LED is removed.</p>

<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_3_monitor_shadow_mqtt_topics_for_a_complex_operation_dispense_drink">3. Monitor Shadow  MQTT topics for a Complex Operation (Dispense Drink)</h3><p>The shadow can also be used for more complex operations. While changing the state of the LED can be tracked via a single attribute, operations such as dispensing a drink are more complex and require multiple states such as <em>request</em> and <em>response</em>. The dispenser app initiates the dispense operation as a <em>request</em>, and when the dispenser completes the operation it, in turn, sets a corresponding <em>response</em>. We use a short, random, <code>requestId</code> value to match the correlate the <em>request</em> and <em>response</em> states.</p>
<figure class="image-block"><img src="../../req_res_shadow.svg" alt="req res shadow" width="822" height="593">
<figcaption>Figure 3. Tracking request/response using shadow</figcaption></figure>
<p>As we cannot be sure that the dispenser is online, the dispenser app initiates the request and sets the <em>desired</em> state of the shadow with a <code>request</code> object containing the <code>command</code> to execute, a unique <code>requestId</code>, and the <code>timestamp</code> of when the user clicked "Dispense a Drink" in the dispenser app.</p>
<p>To verify, ensure the microcontroller is connected and LED operations take place. Next, use  <em>Test</em> from the IoT Core console and subscribe to the topic <code>$aws/things/dispenserId/shadow/#</code> (replace <code>dispenserId</code> with your value) to track all shadow operations. Next, in the dispenser app click the <em>Dispense!</em> button (should still be green) to initiate a dispense operation. From the <em>MQTT Client</em> tab, you should see a few shadow topic messages. Scroll through and review how the first message sets the <code>request</code> object, and after the dispenser completes turning the pump (indicated by the animated LED pattern on the LED Ring) the <em>reported</em> state is updated with a <code>response</code> object that has the same <code>requestId</code>, and finally that the the <code>request</code> <strong>and</strong> <code>response</code> objects are both deleted from all shadow sections once the response has been reconciliated.</p>
<p>In this situation, we are using the shadow to track the status of a command sent to the dispenser, and the response once it acts upon it.</p>

<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_4_review_logging_and_credits">4. Review Logging and Credits</h3><p>Oops! While testing how the Shadow works We used up all of our credits. Each dispense operation costs $1.00, and has been deducted from our dispenser credit, as shown by the dispenser app. Navigate to the DynamoDB <em>DispenserTable</em> and verify the credits match the dispenser app. Also, review the <em>EventsTable</em> for your dispenser (review the first steps in this lab if needed) to see the various logging entries made while testing the Ring LED and drink dispense test.</p>
<p>We use these tables as the <em>source of truth</em> for the status of our dispenser. While the dispenser code you compiled and installed could be modified, a dispense operation can only be performed if there are sufficient credits in the account (e.g., DynamoDB DispenserTable entry). We use the value of the <code>dispenserId</code> across the dispenser app (user account custom attribute), IoT Core (Thing name, Certificate CN) and DynamoDB DispenserTable (dispenserId key) to enforce the desired controls in the overall SaaS application.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_5_dispenser_app_overview">5. Dispenser app Overview</h3><p>The dispenser app is your main interface for interacting with the dispenser, eg to dispense a drink, and to check its state. As the dispenser app is running inside your local browser, there are two methods that can be used to track what is the current status. We can continuously <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polling_(computer_science)">poll</a> via an API to return the status, or use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callback_(computer_programming)">callback</a> mechanism to alert the dispenser app when something has changed. In our app we use the <em>callback</em> method, and specifically it does this by subscribing to the MQTT topics for your specific dispenser. This reduces the overall load on the SaaS service and demonstrates how we can use the features of AWS IoT Core to simplify the implementation.</p>
<p>Modern web browsers have the ability to monitor what is running locally. Our dispenser app has additional debug, or <code>console.log()</code> statements to give an indication when something is happening. From your browser, enable the <em>Web Console</em> (name varies based on browser), and select the <em>Console</em> tab. Now change the status of the LED. Every time you make a change, you will see an <em>Received MQTT message with change in LED or credit status</em> message. This is alerted when an incoming MQTT message of interest such as a shadow update occurs.</p>
<p>These messages then trigger the dispenser app to make an API call requesting the complete status of the dispenser (LED status, credits, etc.), which in turn updates the main dispenser page. If there are no changes being made, no MQTT messages are generated, and subsequently, no API calls are made to request an update to the dispenser app.</p>

<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_6_share_the_love">6. Share the Love!</h3><p>Now that we have shown how you interact with your dispenser via the dispenser app, let&#8217;s build our credits up to a sufficient level to complete the rest of the lab. To do this, click on the <em>Share the Love!</em> panel underneath the LED status panel and follow the instructions. First, try giving credit to another dispenser number and monitor the <em>Last credit response</em> message (with or without browser logging). Next, try to give yourself credits and note that the gray button to the right does not change to <em>SEND CREDIT!</em>. This is a constraint built into the dispenser app. However, even if you were to make a direct API call, the backend will also deny the request.</p>
<p>Finally, talk to your neighbors and ask them to start sending you credits. You may also see that as the credits increase, the LED Ring will also start to fill until you have at least $1.00, and after that the colors will changes as your balance goes above $2.00, $3.00, etc.</p>
<p>It is recommended that you have at least $2.00 or $3.00 to perform a couple dispenses with a fully built dispenser unit.</p>
<p>Good work!</p></section></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_checkpoints">Checkpoints</h2><p>Please ensure the following checkpoints are validated before moving on to the next module.</p>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic"><li>The dispenser board operates correctly and you can toggle the LED Ring from the dispenser app</li><li>A dispense operation enables the LED Ring with an animated pattern indicating the microcontroller activates the pump (motor control)</li><li>You have an understanding of how the shadow document and DynamoDB tables are used to track state (LED) and perform command and control (request/response) operations</li></ol></div></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_outcomes">Outcomes</h2><p>Why do we use the shadow document for command and control, when it could also be done with regular MQTT messages? While either pattern are good practices, combining all of the operations into a single location makes it easier to follow for the workshop. As long as there is a way to track each request, the mechanism used doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>
<p>One thing that we didn&#8217;t discuss is the LED Ring. In this case, it is used to give a visual indication of the credit levels. From the dispensers perspective, it is another shadow attribute set to manage. But instead of being set by clicking buttons in the dispenser app, this value is programmatically set by the cloud services whenever there is a change in the credit state of a dispenser. This demonstrates that functionality in not static and can be modified in either device (dispenser) or the application (cloud-side).</p></section>
