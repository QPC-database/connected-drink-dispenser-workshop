	<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_objectives">Objectives</h2><p>This lab module will walk through how the dispenser, webapp, and coupled services interact. It will go into level of detail specific for the workshop. If you would like to review more details, please reference the <a href="../../presenter.html">Setting Up the Workshop</a> documentation for deeper insights. By then end of this module you will have:</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li>An understanding of the relationship between the dispenser (<em>thing</em>), your Cognito user, and the DynamoDB database tables that track and log dispenser activity and state.</li><li>Seen how the dispenser <em>thing</em> uses the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-device-shadows.html">Device Shadow Service for AWS IoT</a> to listen for requested state changes, and also uses it for processing a dispense <em>request</em> and acknowledging a <em>dispense</em> response.</li><li>Tested a <em>dispense</em> request/response operation and monitored what takes place in different scenarios.</li><li>Reviewed dispenser activity from both the DynamoDB <em>EventsTable</em> and also webapp logging.</li><li>An understanding of how the webapp along with the API Lambda functions control how to give credits to others, as well as only initiating a dispense event when there sufficient credits.</li></ul></div></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_steps_to_complete">Steps to Complete</h2><p>Follow each step in order and use the <strong>Open for detailed step-by-step instructions</strong> if required.</p>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_understand_the_aws_iot_thing_cognito_user_and_dynamodb_table_relationships">Understand the AWS IoT Thing, Cognito User, and DynamoDB Table Relationships</h3><p>As a software-as-a-service (SaaS) environment, there needs to be a specific relationship between all of the resources to help enforce the security and operational controls of the actions. At a high level, for each user, this is how the resources are associated with each other:</p>
<p>TODO: puml of thing - cert      - cog user - ddb tables
                      to policy</p>
<p>Each thing has a unique X.509 client certificate for authentication allowing the dispenser to connect publish and subscribe to the MQTT topics specific for that dispenser. This authorization of MQTT topics comes from a common policy that uses substitution variables that read the <em>Common Name</em> value (which is the dispenser Id). The relationship continues into a Cognito User attribute, <code>custom:dispenserId</code>, that is read for every API call. Finally, your dispenser has an entry in the DynamoDB <em>DispenserTable</em> that tracks current the credit balance and also any in-flight or stale command operations.</p>
<p>From the webapp, open the <em>MY DETAILS</em> section and open a new browser tab or window to the Sign-in URL, then login in with the credentials provided. From the AWS Console, review the relationships by view your dispenser and user details in the following AWS services:</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li><strong>AWS IoT Core</strong> - View your thing, the attached certificate details, and the policy associated with the certificate. Also, view the other security policy that is associated with your Cognito user (used to monitor update events).</li><li><strong>Amazon Cognito</strong> - From <em>Manage User Pools</em>, select the <em>workshop-users</em>, Users and Groups, then your select your username. Note the <code>custom:user</code> and <code>custom:dispenserId</code> attribute values.</li><li><strong>Amazon DynamoDB</strong> - From the <em>DispenserTable</em> review the credits value for your dispenser via the <em>dispenserId</em> sort key. From the <em>DispenserEvents</em> table, query with the partition key equal to your dispenserId. As others start to create and operate their dispensers, filtering will limit to just your events.</li></ul></div>

There are two main sections to the shadow document, the <em>desired</em> state and the <em>reported</em> state. In this workshop, our desired settings will originate from the webapp and the dispenser will act upon them and set the correct reported state.</p>
<p>TODO: diagram showing desired and reported state and general interaction examples (setting desired, delta, setting reported)</p>
<p>To see this in action, from the AWS Console navigate to your thing in IoT Core, then select <em>Shadow</em> which will show the current shadow. Note the <code>led</code> attribute in the <em>desired</em> and <em>reported</em> sections, which should be the same. Also notice the value for <code>version</code> in the metadata. This increments each time the shadow is updated. To show the shadow is working, use the webapp to change the state of the LED by either toggling or setting to the other state. You will see the value for <code>led</code> has changed in the shadow document, and <code>version</code> has incremented.</p>
<p>To see how the shadow works when the device is in a disconnected state, unplug the microcontroller from your laptop. Now, in the webapp change the state of the LED and notice that the <em>desired</em> and <em>delta</em> states show this new value,but that the <em>reported</em> state is still what the dispenser was in before being disconnected. Plug the microcontroller back into your laptop. Once it has booted and connected AWS IoT, the LED will change to the <em>desired</em> state value and the dispenser will update the <em>reported</em> state. Since <em>desired</em> and <em>reported</em> states are the same, the <em>delta</em> state for the LED is removed.</p>

<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_monitor_shadow_mqtt_topics_for_a_complex_operation_dispense_drink">Monitor Shadow  MQTT topics for a Complex Operation (Dispense Drink)</h3><p>The shadow can also be used for more complex operations. While changing the state of the LED can tracked via a single attribute, operations such as dispensing a drink are more complex and considered a <em>request</em>/<em>response</em> pattern. The webapp initiates the dispense operation as a <em>request</em>, and when the dispenser completes the operation it, in turn, sends a corresponding <em>response</em>. We use a short, random, <code>requestId</code> value to match the correlate the <em>request</em> and <em>response</em> operations.</p>
<p>TODO: sequence diagram with request, response, and lambda via DDB</p>
<p>As we cannot be sure that the dispenser is online, the webapp initiates the request and sets the <em>desired</em> state of the shadow with a <code>request</code> object containing the <code>command</code> to execute, a unique <code>requestId</code>, and the <code>timestamp</code> of when the user clicked "Dispense a Drink" in the webapp.</p>
<p>To verify, ensure the microcontroller is connected and LED operations take place. Next, use  <em>Test</em> from the IoT Core console and subscribe to the topic <code>$aws/things/dispenserId/shadow/#</code> (replace <code>dispenserId</code> with your value) to track all shadow operations. Next, from another tab or window, click the <em>Dispense!</em> button (should still be green) to initiate a dispense operation. From the <em>MQTT Client</em> tab, you should see a few shadow topic messages. Scroll through and review how the first message sets the <code>request</code> object, and after the dispenser completes turning the pump (indicated by the other LED on the controller board) the <em>reported</em> state is updated with a <code>response</code> object that has the same <code>requestId</code>, and finally that the the <code>request</code> <strong>and</strong> <code>response</code> objects are both deleted from all shadow sections once the response has been reconciliated.</p>
<p>In this situation, we are using the shadow to track the status of a command sent to the dispenser, and the response once it acts upon it.</p>

<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_review_logging_and_credits">Review Logging and Credits</h3><p>We did something bad! We used up all of our credits testing the dispenser operation above. Each dispense operation costs $1.00, and has been deducted from our dispenser, as shown by the webapp. Navigate to the DynamoDB <em>DispenserTable</em> and verify the credits match the webapp. Also, review the <em>EventsTable</em> for your dispenser (review the first steps in this lab if needed) to see the various logging entries made while testing the LED and drink dispense test.</p>
<p>We use these tables as the <em>source of truth</em> for the status of our dispenser. While the dispenser code you compiled and installed could be modified, a dispense operation only is created if there are sufficient credits in your account (e.g., DynamoDB DispenserTable entry). We use the relationship of the <code>dispenserId</code> in your user account via the webapp, associated with the same values in IoT Core and DynamoDB, to track the business logic we want to enforce in the overall SaaS application.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_webapp_overview">Webapp Overview</h3><p>The webapp is your main interface for seeing the state of the dispenser via LEDs, and how to initiate a dispense action. As the webapp is running inside your local browser, there are two methods that can be used to track what is the current status. We can continuously <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polling_(computer_science)">poll</a> via API to return the status, or use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callback_(computer_programming)">callback</a> mechanism to alert the webapp when something has changed. In this case, the <em>callback</em> method is used. It reduces the overall load on the SaaS service and demonstrates how we again use AWS IoT Core to facilitate this.</p>
<p>Modern web browsers have the ability to monitor what is running locally. Our webapp has additional debug, or <code>console.log()</code> statements to give an indication when something is happening. It does this b subscribing to the MQTT topics for your specific dispenser. From your browser, enable the <em>Web Console</em> (name varies based on browser), and select the <em>Console</em> tab. Now change the status of the LED. Every time you make a change, you will see an <em>Received MQTT message with change in LED or credit status</em> message. This is alerted when an incoming MQTT message of interest such as a shadow update occurs.</p>
<p>These messages then trigger the webapp to make an API call requesting the complete status of the dispenser (LED status, credits, etc.), which in turn updates the main dispenser page. If there are no changes being made, no MQTT messages are generated, and subsequently, no API calls are made to request an update to the webapp.</p>

<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_share_the_love">Share the Love!</h3><p>So far we have shown how the you interact with your dispenser via the webapp. Next, let&#8217;s build our credits back up to a sufficient level to complete the rest of the lab. To do this, click on the <em>Share the Love!</em> card underneath the LED status cards and follow the instructions. First, try giving credit to another dispenser number and monitor the <em>Last credit response</em> message (with or without browser logging). Next, try to give yourself credits and note that the gray button to the right does not change to <em>SEND CREDIT!</em>. This is a constraint built into the webapp. However, even if you were to make a direct API call, the backend will also deny the request.</p>
<p>Finally, talk to you neighbor to either side of you and ask them to start sending you credits. You may alsop see that as the credits increase, the ring LED will also start to fill until you have at least $1.00, and after that the colors will changes as your balance goes above $2.00, $3.00, etc.</p>
<p>It is recommended that you have at least $2.00 or $3.00 to perform a couple dispenses with a fully built dispenser unit.</p>
<p>Good work!</p></section></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_checkpoints">Checkpoints</h2><p>Please ensure the following checkpoints are validated before moving on to the next module.</p>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic"><li>The dispenser properly operates and toggles the LED status from the webapp</li><li>A dispense operation enabled the <em>other</em> LED on the controller board (motor control)</li><li>You have an understanding of how the shadow document and DynamoDB tables are used to track the status of state (LEDs) and perform command and control (request/response) operations.</li></ol></div></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_outcomes">Outcomes</h2><p>Why do we use the shadow document for command and control, when it could also be done with regular MQTT messages? While either pattern are good practices, combining all of the operations into a single location makes it easier to follow for the workshop. As long as there is a way to track each request, the mechanism used doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>
<p>One thing that we didn&#8217;t discuss is the ring LED. In this case, it is used to give a visual indication of the credit levels. From the dispensers perspective, it is another shadow attribute set to manage. But instead of being set by clicking buttons in the webapp, this value is programmatically set by the cloud services whenever there is a change in the credit state of a dispenser. This demonstrates that functionality in not static and can be modified in either device (dispenser) or SaaS application (cloud-side).</p></section>
