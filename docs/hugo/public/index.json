At the end of the lab, you will come away with the understanding of:\n The cloud components for interacting with the dispenser How user accounts, things, and database entries are interrelated How the dispenser updates local status ands responds to dispense commands  Steps to Complete Overall Cloud Architecture When interacting with the cloud, the CDD utilizes two main paths, AWS IoT Core for MQTT communication and then a webapp with authentication to interact with the device and supporting databases.\n IoT Bi-Directional Communication - This section uses MQTT to communicate bi-directionally between the AWS cloud and the device. We also use MQTT to notify the webapp user when there have been activities. This eliminates the need for constant polling and only to query via API when there is information to update. API Logic - Most operations are completed via API calls. By using user authentication, each call can be verified to the specific dispenser via the AWS Lambda functionality. Webapp and Authentication/Authorization - This uses Amazon Cognito to authenticate users and provide a Jason Web Token (JWT) with signed attributes such as the corresponding drink dispenser id. The vended credentials are then use to make API calls and to establish a persistent connection to AWS IoT.  User and Dispenser Relationships For each individual user, there is a set of resources created and related during the user account creation process. A user, foo, authenticates with Cognito and is returned a signed JWT that contains information used by the webapp and API Gateway. For instance, user foo is associated with dispenserId of 123. Any API calls made use the dispenserId attribute to ensure that requests are only for the user\u0026rsquo;s dispenser and not someone elses. The value is also used to send and receive messages on specific MQTT topics so that one dispenser cannot be affected by another dispensers actions. This is a common field used throughout the backend cloud services.\nDispenser Operations Your dispenser will only use MQTT to communicate with the cloud services. There are two main methods that a device uses to communicate. The first is through regular topics such as telem/123 where the device can subscribe to receive messages, or it can publish messages directly to the topic. In this case, telem indicates telemetry and normally would be messages sent from the device to the cloud.\nFor this workshop. we actually will use the shadow set of topics. This is a provided service of AWS IoT that tracks the state of a device. Each device has both a desired and reported state. It is common that cloud services would set the desired state, and the next time the device is online, it would read those values, set them locally, and update the reported state accordingly.\nA device can also use the delta state that tracks the difference between desired and reported states.\nThe shadow document will look similar to this:\n{ \u0026#34;desired\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;led_ring\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;count\u0026#34;: 0, \u0026#34;color\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#FF00FF\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;led\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;on\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dispense_time_ms\u0026#34;: 4000, }, \u0026#34;reported\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;led_ring\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;count\u0026#34;: 0, \u0026#34;color\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#FF00FF\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;led\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;off\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dispense_time_ms\u0026#34;: 2500, }, \u0026#34;delta\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;led\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;on\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dispense_time_ms\u0026#34;: 4000 } } In this example, there are two values that have been requested to be changed, led and dispense_time_ms, as reported by the delta state.\nFinally, there are AWS IoT Rules that are triggered upon the content of messages published. In the diagram above, the IoT rule is triggered when the shadow document changes, passing the details to a Lambda function that will write this to the Events database table.\nCheckpoints This module provides a high-level description of the various components used in the workshop. After completing this lab, you should have an understanding of:\n The differences between the physical dispenser and the webapp used to monitor and control it How Cognito and API Gateway are used by the webapp to issue commands or actions How the Dispenser uses MQTT for bi-directional command and control of the device using the Shadow service The differences between the Shadow document states (desired, reported, and delta)  As this lab is informational only, there are no specific checkpoints that need to be completed.\n"

	"content": "Device and Application Message FlowsThe shadow document for devices tracks state of local resources. In the case of the motor board, this is led which maps to the second motor controller, which is not used. This give an indicator that things are working without having to activate the motor.\nThe led_ring is the round ring and count determine how many LED elements to light up, and the color is the RBG color for all active elements. Each of these below will always be in the desired state of the shadow and once online, in the reported state for the device.\n{ \u0026quot;led_ring\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;count\u0026quot;: 0, \u0026quot;color\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;#RRGGBB\u0026quot; }, \u0026quot;led\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;on|off\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;dispense_time_ms\u0026quot;: 2500, } There are also a temporary request and response objects used to track command state. The cloud logic will create the request object in the desired state section of the shadow, and once processed by the device, it will create the response object in the reported state section. Finally, cloud logic will reconcile and clean up the shadow document of any entries left.\nBelow are what the request and response objects should look like. The command and requestId attribute and values must match. For the request object, the timestamp attribute is when the request was made, while in the response object it is when the dispenser completed the operation.\n{ \u0026quot;desired\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;request\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;command\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;dispense\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;requestId\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;1234-5678\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;timestamp\u0026quot;: 12345 } }, \u0026quot;reported\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;response\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;command\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;dispense\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;requestId\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;1234-5678\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;result\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;success\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;timestamp\u0026quot;: 45678 } }, } The following sequence diagrams show the flows for different uses. The first flows are device-to-cloud, then Rules Engine actions, and then API generated flows.\nDevice FlowsTurn on/off LEDUses the device shadow to set the desired state of an LED. The unused motor controller\u0026#8217;s associated LED can be set on or off, while the LED ring can be addressed with an RGB color and number of LEDs to light. All LED operations take place through the device shadow.\nAt creation, the LEDs are all set to a desired state of off. The dispenser hardware should read and honor the shadow settings for the LED.\nFigure 1. Turn on the LED In this flow:\nDispenser subscribes to shadow delta topic, e.g., $aws/things/123/shadow/deltaDispenser publishes desired state change to shadow update for led (LED for second motor controller)If there is a difference between desired and reported states, the delta, \"led\": \"on\" is sent to the dispenserDispenser enables the LED locallyDispenser then publishes teh reported state of LED1 to the shadow update topicRules engine matches update operation and invokes logging event action This is the same flow for led1 and led_ring. For led_ring, the attributes are the amount of LEDs to light (0-5) and the RBG color in hex, e.g., #ff0000 for full red.\nNote: The LED operation can be on or off.\n Activate DispenserUses the device\u0026#8217;s shadow desired state to send a command (request) to the dispenser. After the dispenser has completed the operation, it updates the shadow\u0026#8217;s reported state to acknowledge the request.\nFigure 2. Activate Dispenser In this flow:\nRequest - User clicks on \"dispense\" button in web applicationLambda is invoked for that requestDispenser record readIf there is a good balance and no in-process requests \u0026lt; 5 seconds old:Record a new request in the dispenser recordPublish the request object to the dispensers shadow desired stateLog a successful request eventReturn to the API/web app a success messageIf there is not enough credits or a dispense request is still valid (\u0026lt;5 seconds old):Log an errorReturn to the API/web app a descriptive error The response operation is decoupled from the request in that the dispenser may be in an offline state. Once online, the response flow continues:\nDispenser received a shadow update on $aws/things/shadow/123/delta or $aws/things/shadow/123/update/acceptedIf the timestamp of the request is older than 5 seconds:Add a response object to the reported state with a result=ERROR indicator (optional - if submitted no credits will be deducted)Discard the message and log locallyIf the request is current (less than 5 seconds old):Activate the motor for set durationIn parallel if possible, a response object to the reported state with the same requestIdThe response message triggers the Rules Engine which looks at the shadow document for a state.reported.response objects and if found invokes the Lambda functionLambda determines this is a rules invocation and not APIReads the dispenser recordIf there is a matching requestIddeduct $1.00, clear requestId, update dispenser recordLog successful dispenser operationsDelete (set to null) and request and response objects in the dispensers shadowIf no matching dispense requestId was foundLog error (should not arrive here)Delete (set to null) and request and response objects in the dispensers shadow The Lambda will also clear out a stale dispense request. There can only be one in-flight dispense request in the dispenser\u0026#8217;s record.\nNote: A dispenser may get a free pour if it receives the dispense command and then goes offline before publishing the response message.\n Rules Engine FlowsThese flows are subscriptions made by the rules, and the actions they take.\nLogging EventsThe logging rule monitors all messages published to events and events/#, and invokes a Lambda to persist the events into the DynamoDB EventsTable.\nFigure 3. General Event Logging There are three logging rules for the workshop, all which log events to the EventsTable. The LogShadowEvents rule monitors for shadow update documents, adds the topic which will identify the dispenser, then invokes the ProcessEvents Lambda function. Similarly for messages published to the events and events/nnn (dispenser ID) topics, the LogGenericEvents and LogDispenserEvents rules process the messages and invoke ProcessEvents.\nThe Lambda function parses the incoming details and creates the formatted entries that then published to the DynamoDB EventsTable.\n "

Please ensure that all of these are completed before progressing to the next step.\n An AWS account to be used to host the workshop services and participant IAM user accounts. It is recommended to use or create a new or sandbox account as the participants will have permissions to see resources. Have a local Workstation or laptop available\nTo build and run the CloudFormation steps, you will need a workstation, an EC2 instance, or a laptop. All the steps are written and based on Linux/macOS. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have a similar environment, you may use an Amazon Linux based EC2 instance. No matter what you use, please ensure the following tools are installed:\n AWS CLI with admin credentials (see below) NodeJS \u0026gt;= 8.11.x and npm Python \u0026gt;= 3.6 and pip AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)  The following commands will verify that the command line tools are properly installed: $ aws iam get-account-summary # AWS CLI { \u0026#34;SummaryMap\u0026#34;: { ... } } $ node -v # NodeJS v12.8.0 $ npm -v # Node package manager 6.10.2 $ python --version # Python Python 3.7.4 $ pip --version # Python module manager pip 19.2.2 from ... $ cdk --version # CDK utility (from npm) 1.4.0 (build 175471f) \n An AWS CLI named profile. The profile in ~/.aws/config should contain the target region, and the ~/.aws/credentials file should have an access key and secret access key with administrative access (or minimum to deploy and run the stack). The profile name cdk-user will be used throughout this guide.\n A registered domain name managed by Route 53 in the workshop account. This can either be through registration in Route 53, or making Amazon Route 53 the DNS service for the domain. If we want the URL for the workshop to be cdd.example.com, in Route 53 there needs to be a public hosted zone for example.com.\n To target the appropriate account, region and other aspects, the following entries need to be considered and changed in the config.json file (the default value used in this guide listed first):\n Region - us-west-2Region identifier, must support all AWS resources being used. HostName - cdd.example.comThe fully qualified domain name entry to be created from the Route 53 hosted zone details above (example.com). Note, subdomain entries can also be used such as cdd.foo.example.com, but must be created from Route 53. ProfileName - cdk-user\nThe AWS CLI profile name referenced above. It is used by the build and deploy steps to use the right account and credentials. AdminUserName - adminThe username to log into the web application for administrative purposes. AdminPassword - NO DEFAULT VALUEThis needs to be completed in the config.json file and is only used for web application related tasks, and not for AWS account activities. cloud9InstanceSize - t3.smallInstance size for each participants Cloud 9 environment. Select larger (or smaller) depending upon how long the Amazon FreeRTOS compilation should take. ParticipantLimit - 20The maximum amount of user accounts that can be created, after which, new account creation will fail. It is best to set this to 5-10% above total expected participants.  An Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM) validated server certificate in N. Virginia, to encrypt access to the web application. The certificate needs to be created in the N. Virginia region to work with Amazon CloudFront. Also, the issued certificate must support the fully qualified domain name you wish to use. For example, a certificate for *.example.com is valid for the domain name cdd.example.com, but would not work for cdd.foo.example.com since the wildcard is only matches the third element foo, and not the fourth one, cdd.\n   "

The physical device, which you will build, can dispense a drink from a standard bottle such as soda or water through an controlled air-pump, and uses an ESP32 microcontroller (MCU) as the brains of the operation. Connectivity to AWS IoT is done through a Wi-Fi network connection, and interaction and local device control is performed by an Amazon FreeRTOS application running on the MCU.\nReplace with image of controller calling out the components and connection to the cloud.\n To simulate dispenser activities, a web application (webapp) with user authentication is used. It can control dispensing a drink via the dispenser associated with the user, and to provide credits to other dispensers. This demonstrates how devices can be scoped down to limited permissions and actions, while still taking advantage of robust serverless applications.\nReplace with image of controller icon, web app icon, and cloud with interaction.\n Using This Documentation This section of the document covers the exercises you will be working through to completed the workshop. There are few things to note while walking through the modules:\n Modules build on each other - Please ensure that each module is completed in-order, and if there are checkpoints at the end, each is complete and operational. Do not move onto the next lab until this is validated. If you do have any questions, please raise you hand for support.\n Comprehension over completion - Each module will start with a set of objectives, a step-by-step walk through on how to complete. Besides the how, there will be a set of why takeaways which will be helpful in the future when using these skills.\n Lab context - Some modules be more of seeing what happens when certain operations that place.

	"content": " Objectives In this lab you will configure your laptop for the workshop. By the end of the module you will have:\n A directory or folder to hold all the files required for your dispenser. Installed and tested a device driver to communicate with the microcontroller. Downloaded a command line utility to program (flashed) the microcontroller. Have an open terminal or command prompt ready to issue commands.  The microcontroller is programmed, or flashed, via a USB serial connection from a computer or laptop. Based on the microcontroller chipset, a specific driver is required.\nEach persons laptop is unique and the general instructions may not work for a variety of reasons such as having a older version of the driver loaded, insufficient permissions to install, or older versions of Operating Systems. Please ensure that the checkpoint at the end has been completed prior to starting the next lab.\n Steps to Complete Follow each step in order and use the Open for detailed step-by-step instructions if required.\n1. Create Local Folder Create a local folder called cdd that will contain all downloads and assets needed for the workshop. It is recommended to create this within your web browsers default download location. When asked to download resource X to cdd folder, save or move the files to that folder.\n  Open for detailed step-by-step instructions    Open a file browser for your operating system (Windows: Explorer, macOS: Finder) and navigate to the default download folder used by your web browser. Create a folder named cdd within Downloads. Leave the file browser open as we will be using it to move files around in later modules.    2. Download and Install Serial Driver The microcontroller used in this workshop, the ESP32-DevKitC has a built-in Silicon Labs CP210x serial controller. In order for you laptop to communicate, download and install the CP210x USB to UART Bridge VCP Drivers for your operating system. Follow the instructions exactly, you may be required to provide permissions to the driver and in some cases restart you laptop to complete the installation process.\nUse the installer specific to the exact version of your operating system. Using the wrong driver will not work and may make it difficult to install the proper version later.\n   Open for detailed step-by-step instructions    Open a browser window to the the CP210x USB to UART Bridge VCP Drivers download page. Download the software (the Download VCP link) for your operating system. If in doubt, please verify the version and read the release notes to confirm. Once downloaded, follow the instructions to complete the installation of the driver.  Here are some tips for popular operating systems:\n Windows 10 - Unzip and use installer for either 32-bit or 64-bit. The VCP driver may have been installed by Windows Update, but using the SIlicon Labs provided driver will work with the ESP32-DevKitC. WIndows 7/8/8.1 - Use the default driver, not the serial emulation one. The VCP driver may have been installed by Windows Update, but using the SIlicon Labs provided driver will work with the ESP32-DevKitC. If the default driver does not work, you may try the other driver. macOS/OSX - Mount the DMG file, or use the legacy folder for OSX 10.9 or 101.10. NOTE: On MacOS 10.13 and later, the installation of the driver may be blocked. To unblock, open the System Preferences Security \u0026amp; Privacy pane and unblock the system extension. See Apple Technical Note TN2459 \u0026ldquo;User-Approved Kernel Extension Loading\u0026rdquo; for more information.    3. Download and Install esptool To interact with the microcontroller via the serial USB connection, there is a specific application to be used called esptool. A pre-built executable can be downloaded here for macOS and here for Windows. Unzip or untar the file and place the file in the cdd directory.\nFor Linux users, or to have installed as a Python package, Follow the instructions for your operating system to install the application. If installed correctly the command should accessible from any directory.\n  Open for detailed step-by-step instructions   Option 1 - Executable for macOS and Windows\n Save the macOS or Windows compressed esptool file to your browsers Downloads directory. Unzip or untar and move the esptool file from the esptool folder to the cdd folder. This will allow you to run esptool without having to add it to your PATH.  Option 2 - Install as Python Module\n Navigate to the esptool.py GitHub repository and scroll down to the installation instructions section. For your operating system, follow the instructions to install the Python modules. It is recommended to install in a virtual environment or in such a way so that is doesn\u0026rsquo;t affect your operating system\u0026rsquo;s Python installation.  Optional Installations\nIf you are unable to install the esptool or run it via the options above, there are optional versions available for different operating systems. Please note that these have not been tested, and there may be differences between the arguments referenced in the lab modules and the actual software.\n macOS - If you have brew installed, you can install esptool via brew install esptool. Ubuntu - Recent versions of Ubuntu have esptool as an installable package: sudo apt-get install -y esptool. Other mainline Linux distributions may also have similar packages for installation. All Operating Systems - esptool-ck has compiled versions, please check the releases section.    4. Open Command Line Interface and Test All Components To interact with the microcontroller, you will be doing so from a terminal window (macOS and Linux) or a command prompt (Windows). Create a terminal window and change to the cdd directory you created. Verify that you can run the esptool command, and then verify when you connect just the ESP32 via the serial cable that a new serial device is created.\n  Open for detailed step-by-step instructions    For macOS or Linux, launch a terminal window, for Windows launch a command prompt.  Windows - Launch a cmd.exe (Command Prompt). macOS -  + Space -\u0026gt; terminal.app Linux - Control + Alt + T  From the terminal window, run esptool and verify proper operation:\n$ esptool.py -h usage: esptool [-h] [--chip {auto,esp8266,esp32}] [--port PORT] [--baud BAUD] ... $ Monitor what serial ports are in use before connecting the ESP32.\n For Windows, check the current COMx ports. Note that as you connect and disconnect the ESP32, the COMx number may change for each connection. For macOS, ls -l /dev/tty.* will show the ports. You should not see a tty.SLAB_USBtoUART entry yet. FOr Linux, ls -l /dev/tty.* and note the port numbers.  Connect the ESP32, then run the same commands and look for a new addition. That will be the port you will use when flashing and monitoring the microcontroller. When added to a MacBook Pro, a valid driver installation and good data+power USB connection would show this:\n$ # Before connecting ESP32 to laptop $ ls /dev/tty.* /dev/tty.Bluetooth-Incoming-Port $ # After connecting as above /dev/tty.Bluetooth-Incoming-Port /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART    Checkpoints Please ensure the following checkpoints are validated before moving on to the next module.\n Folder cdd - Verify and note the location of the folder Serial driver installed and tested - When the ESP32 is connected, the driver is working if a new serial port is created (/dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART or similar for macOS, a COMx port for Windows). Command line window left open for other lab modules.  Outcomes Installation of device drivers, tool chains, and utilities such as esptool to interact with microcontrollers is complex, so why do we do it? Unlike cloud environments that can be stood up with infrastructure as code (IaaC), firmware development and testing takes place locally.\nBy completing and testing the installation of the tools in advance of work, we know that our environment is working properly. And if we need to fix or have another laptop or desktop to develop from, the steps to complete setup are documented.\n"

	"content": " This section covers the steps to locally build and then deploy the stack to your preferred region. All steps are completed within the deploy/ directory.\nModify Template Files Copy the deploy/config.json.default to deploy/config.json and modify the new file and change the following parameters with the values from the prerequisites section:\n Region - AWS region to deploy and run the stack (for example, us-west-2 from previous section). HostName - Fully qualified domain name for the stack to build and use, must not exist, it will be created. ProfileName - The name of the AWS CLI profile with administrative permissions.  Process Local Dependencies There are various python packages that need to be installed within the deploy/.env directory in order for CDK to run and process the stack. Follow these steps once to install the dependencies.\nChange to the deploy/ directory and activate the Python virtual environment.\n$ cd Connected_drink_dispenser/cdk $ source .env/bin/activate # sh or bash $ pip install -r requirements.txt Verify by running cdk synth which will return a long CloudFormation stack in YAML. As long as no errors were returned, the cdk synth command has verified dependencies and created the artifacts in the cdk.out/ subdirectory (don\u0026rsquo;t delete this directory).\nDeploy Stack via CDK and CloudFormation With the prerequisites and config.json set, run cdk deploy. This will take at least 30 minutes if not longer as there is a CloudFront (CDN) distribution involved. The final output should look like this:\n✅ cdd-workshop Outputs: cdd-workshop.StaticSiteBucket34E5D9AF = cdd.example.com-static-site cdd-workshop.APIEndpoint = https://xxxxxxx.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/ cdd-workshop.CognitoIdentityPool = us-west-2:38c0c443-xxx-xxxx-xxxx-692ebe311dfe cdd-workshop.UserPoolCognitoUserPoolIdArn107A6E54 = arn:aws:cognito-idp:us-west-2:123456789012:userpool/us-west-2_foo cdd-workshop.StaticSiteDistributionId8C64EF2A = E1MK8XXXX2S9X cdd-workshop.APIEndpoint1793E782 = https://xxxxxxx.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/ cdd-workshop.UserPoolCognitoClientId49B6D8C4 = 4hp8jitmd6virxxxxxo68p6 cdd-workshop.UserPoolCognitoUserPoolIdA08E3514 = us-west-2_foo Stack ARN: arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:stack/cdd-workshop/deadbeef-d008-11e9-8962-02dbab669d48 $ When completed, you should be able to navigate to https://cdd.example.com to verify that CloudFront is working. There will be a NoSuchKey error, which we will fix in the next step, but you can verify that the HTTPS certificate is in place.\nIf there are any errors running cdk deploy, the stack will automatically rollback and delete all the resources. Due to the CloudFront distribution, this will take 30 minutes or longer to complete. Review the error, correct, and re-run the deploy step. Most errors will either be related to permissions associated with the credentials used to deploy, or lack of one of the prerequisites.\nDeploy Application and Documentation With the stack deployed, we need to read some of the outputs from above, create the single page application, and then deploy it and this documentation. To do so, run the deploy_app.py script.\n$ python deploy_app.py Verifying local configuration files Reading CloudFormation stack parameters to create files for web application Clearing S3 bucket of ALL objects Copying web application to S3 |################################| xxx/xxx⏎ Copying online documentation to S3 |################################| 121/121⏎"

	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "ObjectivesThis lab module will walk though creation of user and account resources, and accessing your unique resources. By the end of the module you will have:\nCreated and verify a user account.Understand what takes places during account creation.Know where to navigate in order to download and access your specific resources such as certificate and private key, and access other user details.Been introduced to UML sequence diagrams used to illustrate operations. Resource Creation ProcessWhen you first go through the user creation process, there are no resources created in advance. Once you log in for the first time, the API call that returns your resources will notice there are none and will go about creating them. At a high level, the process looks like this:\nUser John Doe registers and verifies new account jdoe.User created in Cognito User Pool and valid JSON web token returned.As this is the first login, a call to the /getResources method is called and invokes a Lambda function.The function creates all of the unique resources for John on a per-service basis.The following resources are created and the results return to the Lambda function:An AWS IoT thing (dispenser) and certificate are created, and associatedAn IAM user account is created with generated passwordA Cloud9 development environment is createAll of the created resources are stored in a DynamoDB table that can only be accessed by the Lambda function. Finally, the /getResources returns John\u0026#8217;s specific details to be used or displayed in the webapp. This same sequence of events can also be presented using a sequence diagram. Each actor or participant is a column, and from top to bottom are the activities. See if you can associate the diagram above from this sequence diagram figure:\nFigure 1. Create User Resources Process Sequence diagrams a consistent way to depict the flow of steps, especially for complex or multi-step operations. Depending upon what is being described, either of these may be used in the lab modules. Now that you have an understanding of what is taking place behind the scenes, it\u0026#8217;s time to create your account!\n Steps to CompleteFollow each step in order and use the Open for detailed step-by-step instructions if required to create your account and access the resources.\nRegister for an AccountOpen URL provided in the presentation, and click on the create a new account link, or from the SIGN IN link, click on the Sign up link at the bottom of the Sign in page. For your account, enter a Username, Password, and Phone number for your mobile phone to receive a validation code. Once you receive the verification code, enter it to complete the account sign up process.\nNote: The phone number must be in the \"+county code\" format. For instance, a US number would be \"+18005551212\" and for the UK \"+447624\u0026#8230;\u0026#8203;\", etc. If you have questions about the format, or are unable to receive an SMS message, please let one of the lab helpers know and they can complete the process for you.\n   Open for detailed step-by-step instructions   Navigate to the URL provided during the workshop overview. https://cdd.example.com will be used in these instructions, replace with what was provided.From the Welcome to the Connected Drink Dispenser Workshop! section, click on the create a new account link.\nChoose a username (an e-mail address works and will not be used to send any emails), password, and enter your mobile number for SMS verification code.\nThe page will refresh to the Confirm sign up page to enter the Confirmation code. Check your phone for the 6-digit code, enter it, and click CONFIRM. If successful you will directed to the Sign in page.   Initial Log InWith the account created and on the Sign in page, log in with your username/password. Initially you will see a Loading Resource page, and during this first log in, it will pause while the resources are created in the background. This can take approximately 30 seconds or so to complete. Once complete, the dispenser details page will load. Click the MY DETAILS button to open the resources section. Click on the CERTIFICATE FILE, PRIVATE KEY FILE, and AMAZON ROOT CA1 FILE links and save the files to your cdd directory on your laptop. Click the MY DETAILS button to toggle closed.\n  Open for detailed step-by-step instructions   From the Sign in page, enter your your username and password and click LOG IN.The Loading Resource page will appear, followed after a few seconds a notice about resource creation. Do not refresh or click other links at this point. Resource creation can take approximately 30 seconds or so to complete.\nOnce the resources have loaded, toggle the MY DETAILS button to open the resources section. Click on the CERTIFICATE FILE, PRIVATE KEY FILE, and AMAZON ROOT CA1 FILE links and save the files to your cdd directory on your laptop. Click the MY DETAILS button to toggle closed.\nYour browser does not support the video tag. After downloading the files, note that your username appears in the upper right corner indicating you are logged in, and your unique dispenser number and credits are noted in the upper left.   CheckpointsPlease ensure the following checkpoints are validated before moving on to the next module.\nYou have successfully created a user account and saved the user username and password for future use.You have downloaded the certificate file (e.g., 34ea05fe7b-certificate.pem.crt), private key (e.g., 34ea05fe7b-private.pem.key) and root certificate CA (AmazonRootCA1.pem). This validates that all resources have been created in the cloud based on your username and assigned dispenser Id. OutcomesWe provided a detailed explanation of what happens during account and resource creation to show a process for just in time registration of resources. In our case, it was the creation of the user account and resources, but a similar pattern can also be used to generate AWS IoT things, certificates, and policies just as a new device needs them, and not in advance.\nIf you are interested in how the resource creation process takes place, look at the code for the ApiGetResourcesFunction Lambda function when you are logged into the AWS Console.\n "

The table can be read by participants, but only updated by the admin user and Lambda functions.\nThis table tracks the status of credits, in-flight requests (requests), and other details regarding each dispenser.\nThe requests attribute contains a DynamoDB list of different in-flight requests. In this workshop, only the following is used (in JSON format):\n[ \u0026quot;1234-5678|dispense|12345678|device\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;4567-8901|anothercommand|87654321|device\u0026quot;, ] Both devices and applications interact with the list and construct a JSON message based on the contents, such as:\n{ \u0026quot;clientId\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;123\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;requestId\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;1234-5678\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;command\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;dispense\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;timestamp\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;12345678\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;target\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;device\u0026quot; } This is the representation of the first entry in the list. As requests are completed, the entity that validates the completion will remove them from the list. clientId maps to the dispenserId.\n User account setup and sign-inCognito sign-up and sign-in calls are made. When signing in, the app calls the GetResources method which checks if the authenticated user has a resources entry in the database. If it does, the values are returns. If not, it immediately returns a message so the app can request the CreateResources method. This method executes the following to create the resources:\nCheck if at limit for workshopUse username to create IAM user and credentialsCreate thing, certificate, attach to policycreate Cloud9 instance for userUpdate DynamoDB with the contents And after creation the values are returned within a 25 second period. The application should set a notice to the user that assets are being created and to wait.\nFigure 1.
